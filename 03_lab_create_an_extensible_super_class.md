## Lab: Create an Extensible Super Class
```

Complete the following:

1. Using the code created in the previous exercise, create an extensible
superclass definition. Set the properties and methods that subclasses will need.

2. Create one or more subclasses that extend the superclass with constants,
properties and methods specific to the subclass.

3. Instantiate a couple of objects from the subclasses and execute the methods
producing some output.
