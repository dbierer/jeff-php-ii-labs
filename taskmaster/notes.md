# Notes

Idea is a "To-Do List" type of app. I like the name TaskMaster.

A core class would be the Task class.

Tasks would have attributes like an ID, a title, a description, a location
(for example, work, or home), an expiry (or due date), frequency (how often
they reoccur, if at all), and some fun attributes like, enjoyment which would
be an integer from 1 to 10 rating how 'fun' the task would be to complete,
as well as importance, an integer from 1 to 10, rating how seriously one
should consider completing the task.
